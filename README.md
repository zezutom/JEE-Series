# JEE Series
JEE 7 examples and experiments. Inspired by [Netbean's JEE Learning Trail](https://netbeans.org/kb/trails/java-ee.html).

My implementation:
* doesn't dependend on any IDE
* runs on Maven
* has only a minimum configuration
* includes test automation

## [A Simple Web App](https://github.com/zezutom/JEE-Series/tree/master/SimpleWebJSP)
Remake of [Introduction to Developing Web Apps](https://netbeans.org/kb/docs/web/quickstart-webapps.html)

Highlights:
* in sync with the original example showcases the use of JSP and JavaBeans
* runs on Tomcat (JEE 7 requires Tomcat 8)
* integration tests via [HtmlUnit](http://htmlunit.sourceforge.net)
